# Solid-Quake-Adventure
Hello and welcome to the Quake adventure called "Vier to Nichts(Four to None) Gun Game!", a competitive Quake and Call of Duty inspired multiplayer deathmatch.
The title is a work in progress, but the object of the game is
two to four players spawn into a map with a random weapon.
When a player eliminates someone, they get an upgrade to a better or worse weapon than they had before.
If a player is able to eliminate 4 players,
in other words, eliminated a player with each weapon given to them,
They respawn on the map with no weapons except their bare fists, and that player has to melee everyone else before they die in order to win.
If a player dies before they can upgrade their weapon, they are left with the  weapon they acquired previously in the game.
For more information, you can check the wiki page for the game with this link.
